Now when the CasparCG 2.3 LTS is near release you want an easy way of doing Templates, don't you.

1. Get Tumult HYPE Pro (Sorry!) Not free software. But if someone wants to try to reconstruct the project for the simpler version you are welcome. This is sadly just a MacOS software. There is a software named Saola that exists on both Windows and Mac which I have but it is not even close in what you can do and how easy it makes it.
2. Download Repo 
3. Unzip `CasparCG_Template_Master.hypetemplate.zip`
4. Double-click `CasparCG_Template_Master.hypetemplate`
5. Do your stuff
6. Export as folder
7. Move the folder to the template directory on your CasparCG 2.3
8. Enjoy!

In the `utils` folder there is an Exportscript you add to Hype to make it easier and a more customized export for CasparCG.
You can read about how you install and use them here.

Please help me extend this repo with more fun things.
